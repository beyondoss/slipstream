# Rust Production Audit Checklist

A comprehensive checklist for auditing Rust codebases, focused on patterns that compile cleanly but cause real production issues. Organized by severity and likelihood of occurrence.

---

## 1. Memory Safety Escape Hatches

### `unsafe` blocks

- [ ] Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining the invariant being upheld
- [ ] `unsafe` is not used to bypass borrow checker frustration (lifetime workarounds, self-referential structs)
- [ ] No `unsafe` in application code that could be replaced with safe abstractions
- [ ] `#[deny(unsafe_code)]` is set at the crate root for application crates
- [ ] Any `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` overrides are reviewed and justified
- [ ] FFI boundaries have wrapper types that enforce invariants on the safe side
- [ ] Raw pointer dereferences have documented aliasing and validity guarantees

### `std::mem::transmute`

- [ ] No `transmute` between types with different sizes or alignments
- [ ] No `transmute` to bypass visibility or lifetime constraints
- [ ] Prefer `from_ne_bytes`, `to_ne_bytes`, or `bytemuck` for type punning
- [ ] Every `transmute` call has a comment explaining why a safe alternative isn't possible

### `unsafe impl Send` / `unsafe impl Sync`

- [ ] Every manual `Send`/`Sync` impl has a documented proof of thread safety
- [ ] No blanket `unsafe impl Send for MyType` just to make the compiler happy
- [ ] Wrapper types around raw pointers (`*mut T`) actually enforce the concurrency guarantees they claim

### `String::from_utf8_unchecked` and similar `_unchecked` functions

- [ ] Input is provably valid (e.g., came from a `String` originally)
- [ ] Prefer the checked variant unless profiling proves it's a bottleneck
- [ ] `from_raw_parts`, `get_unchecked`, `unreachable_unchecked` — same scrutiny

---

## 2. Panics and Unwinding

### `.unwrap()` and `.expect()`

- [ ] `clippy::unwrap_used` and `clippy::expect_used` are denied in CI (not just warned)
- [ ] No `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` without a comment explaining why the value is guaranteed
- [ ] Library code never panics on invalid input — return `Result` or `Option`
- [ ] `.expect()` messages describe the invariant, not the error ("config must be loaded before server starts", not "failed to unwrap")

### `panic!()`, `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`

- [ ] No `todo!()` or `unimplemented!()` in code paths reachable in production
- [ ] `panic!()` is reserved for genuine invariant violations, not input validation
- [ ] Grep the codebase: `rg 'todo!\(|unimplemented!\(|panic!\(' --type rust`

### Array/slice indexing

- [ ] No unchecked indexing (`array[i]`) in hot paths where `i` could be out of bounds
- [ ] Prefer `.get()` and handle `None`, or prove bounds with prior checks
- [ ] Watch for off-by-one: `vec[vec.len()]` compiles, panics at runtime

### Integer overflow

- [ ] Debug builds panic on overflow (default), but release builds **wrap silently**
- [ ] Use `checked_add`, `saturating_add`, or `wrapping_add` to make overflow behavior explicit
- [ ] Audit any arithmetic on user-provided values or sizes

---

## 3. Resource Leaks

### `Box::leak()`

- [ ] Only used for truly `'static` data (singletons, global config)
- [ ] Not used as a workaround for lifetime complexity
- [ ] Grep: `rg 'Box::leak' --type rust` — every hit should be justified

### `std::mem::forget()`

- [ ] Destructors / `Drop` impls that are skipped don't hold resources (file handles, locks, network connections)
- [ ] Not used to prevent double-free — that indicates a deeper ownership problem
- [ ] `ManuallyDrop` is preferred when drop timing needs to be controlled

### `Rc` / `Arc` reference cycles

- [ ] Any graph or tree structure using `Rc`/`Arc` has `Weak` references for back-edges
- [ ] Parent-child relationships: parent owns child via `Rc`, child references parent via `Weak`
- [ ] No `Rc<RefCell<T>>` cycles — these will never be freed

### Unbounded collections

- [ ] `HashMap`, `Vec`, `VecDeque` that grow based on external input have a capacity bound or eviction policy
- [ ] Caches have a max size (LRU, TTL, or hard cap)
- [ ] Unbounded `mpsc::channel()` — prefer `sync_channel` with a bound, or document why unbounded is safe
- [ ] Log buffers, event queues, retry queues — anything that accumulates has a limit

### File descriptors and handles

- [ ] `File`, `TcpStream`, `UdpSocket` are dropped or explicitly closed
- [ ] No long-lived ownership of file handles that should be short-lived
- [ ] In `async` code: watch for held-open connections across `.await` points

---

## 4. Concurrency

### Deadlocks

- [ ] Multiple `Mutex` locks are always acquired in a consistent global order
- [ ] No lock held across `.await` (use `tokio::sync::Mutex` if needed, but prefer restructuring)
- [ ] `RwLock` write starvation: check that read-heavy workloads don't starve writers indefinitely
- [ ] No recursive locking (Rust's `Mutex` is not reentrant — will deadlock)

### Async pitfalls

- [ ] No blocking calls (`std::fs`, `std::net`, `thread::sleep`) inside `async` functions — use async equivalents
- [ ] `tokio::spawn` tasks have proper cancellation handling (check `select!` branches)
- [ ] `JoinHandle`s are not silently dropped — panics in spawned tasks are lost
- [ ] Dropping a `JoinHandle` detaches the task, it doesn't cancel it
- [ ] Watch for holding `MutexGuard` across `.await` — this is a deadlock or send error waiting to happen

### Atomics

- [ ] `Ordering::Relaxed` is only used when ordering genuinely doesn't matter
- [ ] No `Ordering::Relaxed` on flags used for synchronization (use `Acquire`/`Release` or `SeqCst`)
- [ ] Prefer higher-level primitives (`Mutex`, channels) unless profiling demands atomics

---

## 5. Error Handling

### Silent error swallowing

- [ ] No bare `let _ = fallible_call();` without a comment
- [ ] `#[deny(unused_must_use)]` is set — `Result` values cannot be silently dropped
- [ ] No `#[allow(unused_must_use)]` without justification
- [ ] `.ok()` on a `Result` — confirm the error case is truly irrelevant
- [ ] `catch_unwind` — panics are being caught, not silenced. Logged? Propagated?
- [ ] Batch operations (loops over files, retries, fan-outs) track and propagate the **worst** outcome, not just the last `Result` — a single failure mid-loop shouldn't report success

### Error type design

- [ ] Errors carry enough context to debug without reproducing (`thiserror` or manual `Display`)
- [ ] No `Box<dyn Error>` in library APIs — use concrete types
- [ ] `anyhow` is fine for applications, not for libraries
- [ ] Error chains are preserved — `.context()` or equivalent, not discarded

---

## 6. Lint Suppression and Compiler Bypasses

### `#[allow(...)]` audit

- [ ] Grep: `rg '#\[allow' --type rust` — review every suppression
- [ ] No crate-level `#![allow(warnings)]` or `#![allow(clippy::all)]`
- [ ] Each `#[allow]` has an accompanying comment with justification
- [ ] `#[allow(dead_code)]` — is this actually dead code that should be removed?
- [ ] `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` — is the unwrap actually infallible here?

### CI enforcement

- [ ] Clippy runs with `-D warnings` (deny, not warn)
- [ ] `#[deny(unsafe_code)]` at crate root for application crates
- [ ] `#[deny(unused_must_use)]` at crate root
- [ ] Clippy lints cannot be overridden by local `#[allow]` without review (enforce via CI grep or policy)

---

## 7. Process and System

### `std::process::abort()` and `std::process::exit()`

- [ ] Neither is called in library code
- [ ] Both bypass all destructors — confirm no cleanup is needed
- [ ] Exit codes are meaningful and documented

### Signal handling

- [ ] `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` handlers exist for long-running services
- [ ] Handlers use async-signal-safe operations only (no allocations, no locks)
- [ ] Graceful shutdown drains in-flight work before exiting

---

## 8. Serialization and Data Integrity

### `serde` pitfalls

- [ ] `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` on types where unknown fields indicate a problem
- [ ] `#[serde(default)]` values are correct — not just `Default::default()` when zero/empty is wrong
- [ ] Deserialization of untrusted input has size limits (prevent billion-laughs style attacks)
- [ ] Enum deserialization is forward-compatible — `#[serde(other)]` on catch-all variant if needed
- [ ] No `#[serde(skip)]` on fields that are security-relevant

### Type confusion

- [ ] Newtype wrappers for domain types that shouldn't be interchangeable (`UserId(u64)` vs `OrderId(u64)`)
- [ ] No bare `String` for structured data (URLs, paths, emails) — use validated newtypes

---

## 9. Performance Footguns

### Cloning

- [ ] No `.clone()` in hot loops without profiling justification
- [ ] `Arc::clone()` is cheap, `Vec::clone()` is not — know which you're calling
- [ ] Prefer borrowing over cloning unless ownership is required

### Allocation

- [ ] `String` and `Vec` in hot paths use `with_capacity` when size is known
- [ ] No repeated `format!()` or string concatenation in tight loops
- [ ] `collect::<Vec<_>>()` on large iterators — consider streaming/lazy alternatives
- [ ] Watch for implicit allocations: `to_string()`, `to_vec()`, `into()` on borrowed data

### Regex

- [ ] `Regex::new()` is called once and reused (not compiled per invocation)
- [ ] Use `lazy_static!` or `once_cell::Lazy` for static regex patterns
- [ ] Untrusted regex patterns have complexity limits (`regex` crate is safe, but slow patterns exist)

---

## 10. Filesystem and System Boundary Safety

These bugs live at syscall and OS boundaries — Rust's type system cannot prevent them.

### TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use)

- [ ] No check-then-act on filesystem paths (e.g., `metadata()` then `open()`, `remove_file()` then `File::create()`)
- [ ] Use `OpenOptions::create_new(true)` to atomically create-or-fail without a race window
- [ ] Prefer file-descriptor-anchored operations over re-resolved path strings where possible
- [ ] Grep: `rg 'fs::remove_file|fs::rename|fs::metadata' --type rust` — look for a paired `create`/`open` call nearby

### Insecure Permission Windows

- [ ] Files and directories are not created with default permissions and then hardened via `set_permissions()` afterward — there is a window between creation and hardening
- [ ] Use `OpenOptions::mode()` (Unix) or `DirBuilder::mode()` to set permissions atomically at creation time
- [ ] Grep: `rg 'set_permissions' --type rust` — check for a preceding `create` or `create_dir` on the same path

### Path Identity vs. String Equality

- [ ] Paths guarding security decisions are not compared as raw strings — `/../`, `/./`, symlinks, and relative forms can alias the same inode while comparing unequal
- [ ] Use `fs::canonicalize()` before comparing paths used for access control
- [ ] Grep: `rg 'path ==' --type rust` — flag any equality check on `Path`/`PathBuf`/`str` used for authorization

### Trust Boundary Code Loading

- [ ] No library calls that load dynamic modules (NSS lookups, PAM, `dlopen`) _after_ crossing a privilege or chroot boundary — an attacker controls the chroot tree and can supply malicious modules
- [ ] Resolve usernames, group memberships, and hostnames _before_ calling `chroot()`, dropping privileges, or entering a sandbox
- [ ] Grep: `rg 'chroot|setuid|setgid' --type rust` — verify all NSS/resolver calls (`get_user_by_name`, `getaddrinfo`, etc.) precede the boundary crossing

---

## 11. Binary Data and Encoding Assumptions

- [ ] Stream data, file content, and filenames are handled as `&[u8]` / `Vec<u8>` / `OsStr` — not converted to `String` unless the encoding is guaranteed by the source
- [ ] No `String::from_utf8_lossy()` on data that must round-trip without corruption — it silently replaces invalid bytes with `U+FFFD`, causing data loss
- [ ] `from_utf8()` failures on filenames or path arguments are surfaced as errors, not silently skipped or unwrapped
- [ ] Binary output uses `Write::write_all()` rather than `print!` / `println!`, which assume UTF-8 and may panic or corrupt on non-UTF-8 bytes
- [ ] Grep: `rg 'from_utf8_lossy|String::from_utf8\b' --type rust` — verify each call site is intentional and won't corrupt data

---

## Concerns Summary

| # | Gap           | Type          | Effort   | ICE   |
| - | ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1 | {description} | {performance} | {effort} | {n.n} |

## Quick Wins

{Top 3 tests that add the most confidence with least effort.}

```
## Calibration Rules

- **Stack rank honestly.** The #1 missing test should catch the most dangerous bug.
- **Do not list more than 15 gaps.** Keep the top 15 by ICE score.
- **Every gap must be specific.** Not "add more error tests" but "test that `CreateVM` returns `AlreadyExists` when called twice with the same ID."
- **Sketches only for high-ICE items.** Don't pad the output with boilerplate test skeletons for every gap.
- **Wire compat tests are non-negotiable.** If a Go consumer lacks `wire_compat_test.go`, that is always high-ICE.
